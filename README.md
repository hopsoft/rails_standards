# Rails 3.2 Development Standards Guide

## Approach

Apply the [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain't_gonna_need_it) and
[KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principles to all of the following.

* General architecture
* Product and API features
* Implementation specifics

## Files

* Spaces not tabs
* tab = 2 spaces
* Unix line endings
* UTF-8 encoding

## Documentation

Make an effort for code to be [self documenting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting).

* Prefer descriptive names in your code. e.g. `user_count` is a better name than `len`.
* Use [YARD](http://yardoc.org/) formatted comments when code documentation is deemed necessary.
* Avoid in method comments as they are a cue that the method is too complex; refactor instead.

## General Guidelines

These guidelines are based on [Sandi Metz's](http://sandimetz.com/) programming "rules" which she introduced on
[Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/087-rr-book-clubpractical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-with-sandi-metz/).

The rules are purposefully aggressive and are designed to give you pause so your app won't run amok.
It's expected that you will break them for pragmatic reasons... **alot**.
*See the note on [YAGNI and KISS](#approach).*

* Classes can be no longer than 100 lines of code.
* Methods can be no longer than 5 lines of code.
* Methods can take a maximum of 4 parameters.
* Controllers should only instantiate 1 object.
* Views should only have access to 1 instance variable.
* Never directly reference another class/module from within a class.
  *Such references should be passed in*.

*Be thoughtful when applying these rules.
If you find yourself fighting the framework, it's time to be a little more pragmatic.*

## Models

* Never use dynamic finders. e.g. `find_by_...`
* Be thoughtful about using [callbacks](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html)
and [observers](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Observer.html) as they can lead to unwanted coupling.

**All models should be organized using the following format.**

```ruby
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  # includes ..................................................................
  # extends ...................................................................
  # security (i.e. attr_accessible) ...........................................
  # relationships .............................................................
  # validations ...............................................................
  # callbacks .................................................................
  # scopes ....................................................................
  # additional config .........................................................
  # class methods .............................................................
  # public instance methods ...................................................
  # protected instance methods ................................................
  # private instance methods ..................................................
end
```

*NOTE: The comments listed above should exist in the file to serve as a visual reminder of the format.*

### Model Implementation

Its generally a good idea to isolate different concerns into separate modules.
We recommend using Concerns as outlined in [this blog post](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3372-put-chubby-models-on-a-diet-with-concerns).

```
|-project
  |-app
    |-assets
    |-controllers
    |-helpers
    |-mailers
    |-models
      |-concerns <-----
    |-views
```

#### Guidelines

* CRUD operations that are limited to a single model should be implemented in the model.
  For example, a `full_name` method that concats `first_name` and `last_name`
* CRUD operations that reach beyond this model should be implemented as a Concern.
  For example, a `status` method that needs to look at several other models to calculate.
* Simple non-CRUD operations should be implemented as a Concern.
* **Important!** Concerns should be isolated and self contained.
  They should NOT make assumptions about how the receiver is composed at runtime.
  It's unacceptable for a concern to invoke methods defined in other concerns; however,
  invoking methods defined in the intended receiver is permissible.
* Complex **multi-step** operations should be implemented as a process. _See below._

## Controllers

Controllers should sanitize params before performing any other logic.
The preferred solution is inspired by [this gist from DHH](https://gist.github.com/1975644).

Here's an example of param sanitization.

```ruby
class ExampleController < ActionController::Base
  def create
    Example.create(sanitized_params)
  end

  def update
    Example.find(params[:id]).update_attributes!(sanitized_params)
  end

  protected

  def sanitized_params
    params[:example].slice(:expected_param, :another_expected_param)
  end
end
```

## Processes

A process is defined as a **multi-step** operation which includes any of the following.

* A complex task oriented transaction is being performed.
* A call is made to an external service.
* Any OS level interaction is performed.
* Sending emails, exporting files, etc...

In an attempt to better manage processes, we loosely follow some domain driven development (DDD) principles.
Namely, we have added a `processes` directory under `app` to hold our process implementations.

```
|-project
  |-app
    |-assets
    |-controllers
    |-helpers
    |-mailers
    |-models
    |-processes <-----
    |-views
```

We recommend using a tool like [Hero](https://github.com/hopsoft/hero) to help model these processes.

**Important** *Do not use model or controller callbacks to invoke a process. Instead, invoke processes directly from the controller.*

## Logging

We use the [Yell gem](https://github.com/rudionrails/yell) for logging.
Here's an example configuration.

```ruby
# example/config/application.rb
module Example
  class Application < Rails::Application
    log_levels = [:debug, :info, :warn, :error, :fatal]

    # %m : The message to be logged
    # %d : The ISO8601 Timestamp
    # %L : The log level, e.g INFO, WARN
    # %l : The log level (short), e.g. I, W
    # %p : The PID of the process from where the log event occured
    # %t : The Thread ID from where the log event occured
    # %h : The hostname of the machine from where the log event occured
    # %f : The filename from where the log event occured
    # %n : The line number of the file from where the log event occured
    # %F : The filename with path from where the log event occured
    # %M : The method where the log event occured
    log_format = Yell.format( "[%d] [%L] [%h][%p][%t] [%F:%n:%M] %m")

    config.logger = Yell.new do |logger|
      logger.adapter STDOUT, :level => log_levels, :format => log_format
    end
  end
end
```


## Extensions & Monkey Patches

* Be thoughtful about monkey patching and look for alternative solutions first.
* Use an `initializer` to load extensions & monkey patches.

All extensions & monkey patches should live under an `extensions` directory in `lib`.

```
|-project
  |-app
  |-config
  |-db
  |-lib
    |-extensions <-----
```

Use modules to extend objects or add monkey patches.
*This provides some introspection assistance when you need to track down weirdness.*

Here's an example:

```ruby
module CowboyString
  def downcase
    self.upcase
  end
end
::String.send(:include, CowboyString)
String.ancestors # => [String, CowboyString, Enumerable, Comparable, Object, Kernel]
```

## Gem Dependencies

Gem dependencies should be hardened before deploying the application to production.
This will ensure application stability.

We recommend using [exact or tilde version specifiers](http://gembundler.com/v1.2/gemfile.html).
When using tilde specifiers, be sure to include at least the major &amp; minor numbers.
Here's an example.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'rails', '3.2.11' # GOOD: exact
gem 'pg', '~>0.9'     # GOOD: tilde
gem 'yell', '>=1.2'   # BAD: unspecific
gem 'nokogiri'        # BAD: unversioned
```

Bundler's Gemfile.lock solves the same problem, but we discovered that inadvertent `bundle updates` can cause problems.
It's much better to be explicit in the Gemfile and guarantee app stability.

**This will cause your project to slowy drift away from the bleeding edge.**
A strategy should be employed to ensure the project doesn't drift too far from contemporary gem versions.
For example, upgrade gems on a regular schedule *(every 3-4 months)* and be vigilant about security patches.
Using `bundle outdated` will help with this.

## Planning for Growth

As your project grows in size & complexity, it's critical that you organize your code for optimal maintainability.

Stephan Hagemann presented several strategies, at
[Mountain West RubyConf](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2350-mwrc2013-component-based-architectures-in-ruby-and-rails).
that will help keep your Rails projects organized with well separated concerns.
*The accompanying code can be [viewed here](https://github.com/shageman/the_next_big_thing).*

You should be applying some of these strategies in all of your Rails projects.
Be sure to use judgement and remember that premature optimization often risks momentum and eventual delivery.

## A Note on Client Side Frameworks

Exciting things are happening in the world of client side frameworks.

* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
* [Angular](http://angularjs.org/)
* [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/)
* and many others...

**Be thoughtful about the decision to use a client side framework.**
Ask yourself if the complexity of maintaining 2 independent full stacks is the right decision.
Often times there are better and simpler solutions.

Read the following articles before deciding.
In the end, you should be able to articulate why your decision is the right one.

* [How Basecamp Next got to be so damn fast without using much client-side UI](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to-be-so-damn-fast-without-using-much-client-side-ui)
* [Rails in Realtime](http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/30932219739/rails-in-realtime)
* [Rails in Realtime, Part 2](http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/31462727280/rails-in-realtime-part-2)

*In either case be mindful of "layout thrashing"
as [described here](http://kellegous.com/j/2013/01/26/layout-performance/).*
